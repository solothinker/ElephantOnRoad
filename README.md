## About
ElephantOnRoad is a computer vision project that aims to prevent road accidents involving elephants. The project utilizes the YOLOv5 algorithm for real-time detection of elephants on the road. By deploying this system in areas with elephant habitats, it can provide early warnings to drivers and potentially slow down train speeds when elephants are crossing rail lines.

## Features
- Real-time detection of elephants on the road using the YOLOv5 algorithm.
- Early warning system to alert drivers when elephants are present.
- Potential to adjust train speeds when elephants are crossing rail lines.

## Usage
1. Collect labeled elephant data using the LabelImg tool or other annotation methods.
2. Train the model using the collected data in Google Colab or a similar environment.
3. Obtain video footage or set up cameras in areas with elephant activity.
4. Deploy the ElephantOnRoad system in the desired location.
5. Connect the system to the available cameras or video feed.
6. The system will detect elephants in real-time and provide alerts to drivers or relevant authorities.
7. Optionally, integrate the system with railway infrastructure to adjust train speeds when elephants are crossing rail lines.
